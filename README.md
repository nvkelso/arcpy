A single arcpy script for managing ArcMap MXDs where your data is sourced from random hard drive directories and you need to "collect for output" in print parlance: move all those SHPs to a single directory. It also optionally clips to the current viewport (with buffer) and reprojects into a common CRS. Created in my last two weeks at The Washington Post as I was learning ArcPy, okay to redistribute.
